# WarrenFinalGISD
Final Submission for GISD Research Project (Colorism and Health)

### Organization
I've subdivided files based on analysis and write up. Analysis is further broken down into Stata and R so that both my cleaning and anlysis files are available. 

Please note that some of the paths listed in the various slices of code are for my computer. When running this, please make sure to map pahtways correctly for your own device.
